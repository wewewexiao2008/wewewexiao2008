# 👋 Hi there, I’m Eternal!

## Who Am I?
I’m a researcher diving into the fascinating world of **AI for Protein Design**, specializing in **GPCR**, **binder design**, and **function-oriented design**. I’m passionate about developing innovative tools that empower others in the field.

## What I Do
- **Hallucination-Based Design**: Pushing the boundaries of what's possible in protein design.
- **HPC Optimized Pipeline**: Crafting efficient workflows for high-performance computing (HPC).
- **Interactive Tools**: Developing engaging applications for protein visualization and editing, tailored to modern generative models.
- **CLI Tools and Frontend Development**: Working on tools for protein editing to enhance productivity and creativity.

## My Interests
- **Tech & Productivity**: I'm a fan of personal knowledge management (PKM) tools like Obsidian, Flomo, and other self-hosted solutions that boost productivity and organization.
- **Parallel Computing**: Exploring co-design/all-atom design, protein-protein interaction (PPI) design, and training-free guidance.
- **Art and Music**: I love retro styles, pixel art, and vaporwave aesthetics. I’ve also been inspired by *Oppenheimer* lately.
